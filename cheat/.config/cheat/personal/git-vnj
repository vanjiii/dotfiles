# squash commits (the last 3 for example)
git rebase -i HEAD~3
# into the opening window use `squash` for the commit that you want to sqaush

(dev) git add featureA
(dev) git commit -m "Feature A is done"
[dev fb2f677] Feature A is done
(dev) git add featureB
(dev) git commit -m "Feature B is done"
[dev 733e2ff] Feature B is done

# Your work is in progress and you find minor mistakes in Feature A : it's time to use --fixup option !
(dev) git add featureA                # you've removed a pdb : shameful commit
(dev) git commit --fixup fb2f677
[dev c5069d5] fixup! Feature A is done

Here, you see that GIT automatically retrieved featureA commit message prefixed by fixup!.
All work is done, let's see the log:
(dev) git log --oneline
c5069d5 fixup! Feature A is done
733e2ff Feature B is done
fb2f677 Feature A is done

Now, you want to clean your branch before merging it : it's time to use --autosquash option !
(dev) git rebase -i --autosquash ac5db87
pick fb2f677 Feature A is done
fixup c5069d5 fixup! Feature A is done
fixup c9e138f fixup! Feature A is done
pick 733e2ff Feature B is done

This command has opened your editor with lines above. Just save & quit and ... :
(dev) git log --oneline
ff4de2a Feature B is done
5478cee Feature A is done
ac5db87 Previous commit
