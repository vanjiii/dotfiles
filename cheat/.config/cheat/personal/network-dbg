# DNS resolved it
nslookup domain.com

#

# âžœ  ~ nslookup master-postgres-gps.marathon.mesos
#Server:		127.0.0.53
#Address:	127.0.0.53#53
#
#Non-authoritative answer:
#Name:	master-postgres-gps.marathon.mesos
#Address: 10.101.5.130

# that the IP for that domain is 10.101.5.130

#
telnet 10.101.5.130 5432
